================================================================================
This is just a brief summary of what is working and what is not working.
================================================================================

How to run the codes:
   1. move into the directory in any IDE of your choice
   2. run the code with "go run filename"
   3. follow the promptings as the come *make sure to read them carefully 

ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION:
   The alphabets where not used instead a 16bit digits were used so it can work with the keys provided
   Apart from this, it works very well. NOTE: the words to encode should be without spaces as it 
     encodes the character before the spaces only

NUMBER TO WORD CONVERT:
    1.  It coverts numbers to words OK
    2.  I was wasn't able to complete the codes for reversing words to digits because of time to think and structure my codes

I know I wasn't able to finish the task but I hope to learn more and participate in the internship. Thank you
